In this lab I correctly implemented the html, java script, and my css style sheet all in this lab. 
The google map shows up correctly with the correct location of south station in Boston. Additionally, 
the markers show up in the correct locations. These markers appear as the picture icons of car, and
when you scroll over them the title of each of the cars appear. 
I used the link provided to us as starter code and then edited that, and also used this link to understand how to implement markers.

I spent around 1 hour and 30 minutes on this lab. I ran into an error where I thought
we didn't need the html part in my style sheet, because I moved it to another file, but it took me
a while to realize I needed this key word. My map would not show up for a while until I fixed this.
