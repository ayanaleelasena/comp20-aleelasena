I completed the lab as requested and written a comprehensive report. 
In order to run black box security testing I downloaded the package OSWAP ZAP. 
I was able to succesfully attack all of the get methods in the application serever using this package,
which generated a comphrehensive vulnerability report. 
However, I was not able to use this application to attack the post methods. 
I did this using the curl command. To prove the cross site scripting vulnerability I was able to 
insert html code to generate a pop up as a username into the mongodb database. 
I worked alone on this project but I did look at a number of online resources for security 
vulnerabilties. 
I spent 4 hours on this lab.
