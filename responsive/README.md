I completed the full assignment. The picture correctly appears on the web browser based on the dimensions. I was able to test it using the local file on the web browser. However, I could not test the last case of the browser less than 400 pixels wide, because the browsers on a mac don't go that small. 
I used the links provided to me in the specific lab:
How to use CSS sprites (varvy.com formerly feedthebot.com)
Media Queries for Standard Devices (css-tricks.com)
I also used a few other links to understand how sprites and media queries work. 
I took around an hour to complete this lab. 
I ran into an issue with the media querie syntax, because I did not close
all of the curly brackets originally. It took me a while to find this problem, but I was able to find it and fix it.
