The aspects of the work that have been correctly implemented are that the screen 
prints the lyrics as they appear in sync with the video. 
For understanding how the event listener works I used the website:
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp
I spent almost 2 hours on this lab. I completed it fully in a hour, but I wanted to try 
to sync it as close as I possibly could to the video, and I spent another hour editing
my code.
